#LATCH INSTALATION GUIDE FOR SSH


##PREREQUISITES
* OpenSSH.

* C compilator gcc and make.
For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS,
```
sudo yum install gcc make
```

* Libraries (only if GUI is used): tkinter.

For Debian/Ubuntu,
```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```
For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS,
```
sudo yum install tkinter
```

* To get the **"Application ID"** and **"Secret"**, (fundamental values for integrating Latch in any application), itâ€™s necessary to register a developer account in [Latch's website](https://latch.elevenpaths.com). On the upper right side, click on **"Developer area"**.


##DOWNLOADING THE SSH PLUGIN
* When the account is activated, the user will be able to create applications with Latch and access to developer documentation, including existing SDKs and plugins. The user has to access again to [Developer area](https://latch.elevenpaths.com/www/developerArea), and browse his applications from **"My applications"** section in the side menu.

* When creating an application, two fundamental fields are shown: **"Application ID"** and **"Secret"**, keep these for later use. There are some additional parameters to be chosen, as the application icon (that will be shown in Latch) and whether the application will support OTP  (One Time Password) or not.

* From the side menu in developers area, the user can access the **"Documentation & SDKs"** section. Inside it, there is a **"SDKs and Plugins"** menu. Links to different SDKs in different programming languages and plugins developed so far, are shown.


##INSTALLING THE PLUGIN IN SSH
* Go to **"python"** directory in plugin package, open and edit **"latch-model.conf"** file. Add **"Application ID"** and **"Secret"** data, generated previously and save it in the same directory as **"latch.conf"**.

* Cd to the top-level directory of the plugin, and use the command to install it:
````
sudo ./install
````
* Restart SSH service.

For Debian/Ubuntu,
```
sudo service ssh restart
```
For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS,
```
sudo service sshd restart
```

* For pairing from command line, use **"pairSSH + TOKEN GENERATED BY LATCH"** command. From a console, execute **"latchSSH"**.

* For pairing from command line, use **"unpairSSH"** command. From a console, execute **"latchSSH"**.

##UNINSTALLING THE PLUGIN IN SSH
* Open a terminal. Move to **"python"** directory. Run:
````
sudo python uninstall.py
````

* Linux Restart SSH

For Debian/Ubuntu,
```
sudo service ssh restart
```
For RedHat/Fedora/CentOS,
```
sudo service sshd restart
```
